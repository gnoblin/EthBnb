# EthBnb

EthBnb is a simple Ethereum smart contract written in Solidity, which lets a landlord rent out flats using Ethereum. I wrote it from scratch, without using any boiler plate code.

The code is commented to death, as I was learning Solidity while writing it ;) 

I've also [published a tutorial on Medium](https://medium.com/sandor-report/ethbnb-building-a-simple-solidity-smart-contract-42a8afe1ca4a), if you want a line-by-line breakdown.
